### [@Lee03, number C.12] The Chain Rule for Partial Derivatives

\gvn Let $U \subset \RR^n$ and $\tilde{U} \subset \RR^m$ be open subsets, and let $x = (x^1, \ldots, x^n)$ denote the standard coordinates on $U$ and $y = (y^1, \ldots, y^n)$ those on $\tilde{U}$.

\wts 

(a) A composition of $C^1$ functions $F \colon U \to \tilde{U}$ and $G \colon \tilde{U} \to \RR^p$ is again of class $C^1$, with partial derivatives given by 
$$\pdv{(G^i \circ F)}{x^j}(x) = \sum_{k = 1}^m \pdv{G^i}{y^k}(F(x))\pdv{F^k}{x^j}(x).$$

(b) If $F$ and $G$ are smooth, then so is $G \circ F$.

### [@Lee03, number C.39] Two canonical examples

To verify Example C.37 (Polar Coordinates).

> As you know from calculus, polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ in the plane are defined implicitly by the relations $x = r \cos \theta$, $y = r\sin \theta$. The map $F \colon (0, \infty) \times \RR \to \RR^2$ defined by $F(r, \theta) = (r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)$ is smooth and has Jacobian determinant equal to $r$, which is nonzero everywhere on the domain. Thus, by Corollary C.36
>
> > Suppose $U \subset \RR^n$ is an open subset, and $F \colon U \to \RR^n$ is a smooth function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at every point in $U$. Then $F$ is an open map. Moreover, if $F$ is injective, then $F \colon U \to F(U)$ is a diffeomorphism.
>
> the restriction of $G$ to any open subset on which it's injective is a diffeomorphism onto its image. One such subset is $\{(r, \theta): r > 0, -\pi < \theta < \pi\}$, which is mapped bijectively by $F$ onto the complement of the nonpositive part of the $x$-axis.

To verify Example C.38 (Spherical Coordinates).

> Similarly, spherical coordinates on $\RR^3$ are the functions $(\rho, \phi, \theta)$ defined by the relations 
\begin{align*}
    x &= \rho \sin\phi \cos \theta,\\
    y & = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta,\\
    z &= \rho \cos \phi.
\end{align*}
> Geometrically, $\rho$ is the distance from the origin, $\phi$ is the angle from the positive $z$-axis, and $\theta$ is the angle from the $x > 0$ half of the $(x, z)$-plane. If we define $G \colon (0, \infty) \times (0, \pi) \times \RR \to \RR^3$ by $$G(\rho, \phi, \theta) = (\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta, \rho\sin\phi\sin\theta, \rho\cos\phi),$$ a computation shows that the Jacobian determinant of $G$ is $\rho^2\sin\phi \neq 0$. Thus, the restriction of $G$ to any open subset on which it is injective is a diffeomorphism onto its image. One such subset is $$\qty{(\rho, \phi, \theta) : \rho > 0, 0 < \phi < \pi, -\pi < \theta < \pi}.$$ (Notice how much easier it is to argue this way than to try to construct an inverse map explicitly out of inverse trigonometric functions.
