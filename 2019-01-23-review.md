### [@Lee03, number C.11] The Chain Rule for Partial Derivatives

\gvn Let $U \subset \RR^n$ and $\tilde{U} \subset \RR^m$ be open subsets, and let $x = (x^1, \ldots, x^n)$ denote the standard coordinates on $U$ and $y = (y^1, \ldots, y^n)$ those on $\tilde{U}$.

\wts 

(a) A composition of $C^1$ functions $F \colon U \to \tilde{U}$ and $G \colon \tilde{U} \to \RR^p$ is again of class $C^1$, with partial derivatives given by 
$$\pdv{(G^i \circ F)}{x^j}(x) = \sum_{k = 1}^m \pdv{G^i}{y^k}(F(x))\pdv{F^k}{x^j}(x)$$.

(b) If $F$ and $G$ are smooth, then so is $G \circ F$.
