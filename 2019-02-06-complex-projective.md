### [@Lee03] Problem 1-9

\gvn We assume the statement of Lee's smooth manifold chart lemma [@Lee03, number 1.35]. We will compare this lemma to Do Carmo's definition of a differentiable manifold [@Car76, chapter 0.2].

\wts Complex projective space $\CC P^n$ is a smooth $2n$-dimensional manifold with structure generated by $n+1$ projective charts.

\pf

### [@Lee03] Problem 1-11

\gvn The closed unit ball $\bar{\mathbf{B}}^n$ as a set of points in $\RR^n$.

\wts $\bar{\mathbf{B}}^n$ is a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold with boundary, which we can endow with a smooth structure such that:

- the interior $\mathbf{B}^n$ is parameterized by coordinates in the interior of the half space $\mathbf{H}^n$,
- the boundary $S^{n-1} = \partial \bar{\mathbf{B}}^n$ is parameterized by coordinates at the boundary of $\mathbf{H}^n$, and
- every interior chart is a chart for the standard structure on $\mathbf{B}^n$ as an open submanifold of $\RR^n$.

\pf

### [@Lee03] Exercise 2.3

\gvn Let $M$ be a smooth manifold (with or without boundary). Say $f \colon M \to \RR^k$ is a smooth function.

\wts The composition $f \circ \phi^{-1} \colon \phi(U) \to \RR^k$ is smooth for *every* open chart $(U, \phi)$ for $M$.

\pf

\newpage

### [@Lee03] Exercise 2.9

\gvn Say $F \colon M \to N$ is a smooth map between smooth manifolds (with or without boundary). 

\wts The coordinate representation of $F$ with respect to *every* pair of smooth charts for $M$ and $N$ is smooth.

\pf 

\newpage

### [@Lee03] Problem 2-1

\gvn Consider the function $f \colon \RR \to \RR$ defined by 
$$f(x)= \begin{cases}1,& x \ge 0,\\ 0, & x < 0\end{cases}.$$

\wts For each real number $x \in \RR$, there are smooth coordinate charts $(U, \phi)$ and $(V, \psi)$ containing $x$ and $f(x)$ respectively such that $$\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1} \quad \text{ is smooth from $\phi(U \cap f^{-1}(V))$ to $\psi(V)$.}$$
However, there are charts for which $U \cap f^{-1}(V)$ is *not* open. (By definition then, $f$ is *not* a smooth map between manifolds [@Lee03, number 2.5].)

\pf
